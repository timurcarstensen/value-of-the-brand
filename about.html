            This database is part of a research project which is currently conducted at the Kühne Logistics University (KLU) in Hamburg and the University of Cologne. In this research project, we analyze why estimated brand values differ significantly for the same brand as well as across brands and time. Executives ask whether they should invest into brand building and how to measure the financial value of brands. They would like to know which industry, market, and firm conditions favor the growth of brand value. To answer this question, we use an even larger database of over 40,000 financial brand values. These financial brand values were obtained from over 20 different brand-valuation methods covering commercial providers, academic methods as well as real market transactions. We match the brand values with financial data for parent firms from COMPUSTAT and CRSP. We apply a meta-analytic approach to reveal systematic differences in brand values that are due to time, product, geography, market, valuation approach, firm-specific and customer-specific factors

            <br> Himme's specialization is on the field of performance measurement, valuation of intangibles, marketing accounting, and cost management. His work is positioned at the accounting-marketing interface. In this context his research deals with the influence of intangibles on accounting metrics like the cost of capital. The aim of the research is to quantify the return of investments in intangible assets like brands, customer equity, or corporate reputation. For determining the return of investments in intangible assets his research also focuses on ways how to measure and to evaluate these assets. Determining the drivers of a successful cost management is another pillar of his research projects. His research has been published among others in Journal of Marketing, International Journal of Research in Marketing, Journal of Management Control, Journal of Business Economics, and Journal of Cost Management. He has also presented his work at major international conferences (e.g., Congress of the European Accounting Association, Marketing Science Conference, Marketing Strategy Meets Wall Street). His work was finalist for the Best Paper Award of the German Academic Association for Business Research (VHB) in 2019 and received the Best Paper Award of the EIASM Interdisciplinary Workshop on Intangibles & Intellectual Capital in 2018. He further won best teaching awards at KLU.
