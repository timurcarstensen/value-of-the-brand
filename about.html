                We compiled a unique database that includes more than 43,000 financial brand values that were obtained from the publicly available websites of 11 different brand-valuation providers. The database allows for a diverse comparison of different financial brand values: For example, visualization of time trends in financial brand values; comparison of different brand values in different industries; comparison of financial brand values from different providers for the same brand etc.. You can customize the comparisons as you like.<br><br>

                This database is part of a research project which is currently conducted at the Kühne Logistics University (KLU) in Hamburg and the University of Cologne. In this research project, we analyze why estimated brand values differ significantly for the same brand as well as across brands and time. Executives ask whether they should invest into brand building and how to measure the financial value of brands. They would like to know which industry, market, and firm conditions favor the growth of brand value. To answer this question, we use an even larger database of over 40,000 financial brand values. These financial brand values were obtained from over 20 different brand-valuation methods covering commercial providers, academic methods as well as real market transactions. We match the brand values with financial data for parent firms from COMPUSTAT and CRSP. We apply a meta-analytic approach to reveal systematic differences in brand values that are due to time, product, geography, market, valuation approach, firm-specific and customer-specific factors
